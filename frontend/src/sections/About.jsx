        <p className="about-text">
          I am a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in
          backend development and full-stack web technologies. I enjoy
          understanding how systems work behind the scenes, from APIs and
          databases to authentication and server logic. I primarily work with
          the MERN stack and focus on writing clean, maintainable code. I
          believe in learning by building projects rather than just following
          tutorials. Currently, I am improving my data structures and backend
          skills to prepare for product-based roles. I aim to grow as a
          developer by continuously learning and solving real-world problems.
